# hello-word
first project - test

Hi, my name is Luis but most people called me Burgos which is my last name, both are OK for me .

I am from Mexico, I am 28 years old, and I have a bachelor degree on Electronics Engineering. 

I worked at Freescale that later merged with NXP in a team focused in providing support for Kinetis family of microcontrollers for Wireless applications such as BLE, Sub GHz, and Zigbee. 

Then I moved to work at OSRAM Continental to develop embedded software for Led Driver Modules. 

And now I am here :)
